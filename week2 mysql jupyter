%load_ext sql

Now that the SQL library is loaded, we need to connect to a database. 
The following command will log you into the MySQL server at mysqlserver as the user 'studentuser' and will select the database named 'dognitiondb' :
%sql mysql://studentuser:studentpw@mysqlserver/dognitiondb

Once you are connected, the output cell (which reads "Out" followed by brackets) will read: "Connected:studentuser@dognitiondb". 
To make this the default database for our queries, run this "USE" command: 
%sql USE dognitiondb

SELECT breed FROM dogs LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5; 
10 rows of data will be returned, starting at Row 6. 
An alternative way to write the OFFSET clause in the query is: 
SELECT breed FROM dogs LIMIT 5, 10;

%load_ext sql 
%sql mysql://studentuser:studentpw@mysqlserver/dognitiondb 
%sql USE dognitiondb

SELECT dog_guid, weight FROM dogs WHERE weight BETWEEN 10 AND 50;

SELECT dog_guid, breed FROM dogs WHERE breed IN ("golden retriever","poodle");

SELECT dog_guid, breed FROM dogs WHERE breed LIKE ("s%");

%%sql SELECT dog_guid, subcategory_name, test_name FROM reviews WHERE YEAR(created_at) = 2014 LIMIT 10;

%%sql SELECT user_guid, gender, breed FROM dogs WHERE gender = "female" AND breed LIKE ("%terrier%") LIMIT 5;

SELECT dog_guid, created_at AS time_stamp FROM complete_tests

Note that if you use an alias that includes a space, the alias must be surrounded in quotes: SELECT dog_guid, created_at AS "time stamp" FROM complete_tests

You could also make an alias for a table: SELECT dog_guid, created_at AS "time stamp" FROM complete_tests AS tests

When the DISTINCT clause is used with multiple columns in a SELECT statement, the combination of all the columns together is used to determine the uniqueness of a row in a result set.

SELECT DISTINCT user_guid, (median_ITI_minutes * 60) AS median_ITI_sec FROM dogs ORDER BY median_ITI_sec DESC LIMIT 5

breed_list = %sql SELECT DISTINCT breed FROM dogs ORDER BY breed; breed_list.csv('breed_list.csv')

SELECT DISTINCT breed, REPLACE(breed,'-','') AS breed_fixed FROM dogs ORDER BY breed_fixed

%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM dogs;

When a column is included in a count function, null values are ignored in the count. When an asterisk is included in a count function, nulls are included in the count.

%%sql
SELECT test_name, 
TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, start_time, end_time) AS Duration
FROM exam_answers
LIMIT 3;

%%sql
SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute, start_time, end_time)) 
FROM exam_answers;

SELECT d.dog_guid AS DogID, d.user_guid AS UserID, AVG(r.rating) AS AvgRating, COUNT(r.rating) AS NumRatings, d.breed, d.breed_group, d.breed_type
FROM dogs d JOIN reviews r
  ON d.dog_guid=r.dog_guid AND d.user_guid=r.user_guid
GROUP BY d.user_guid
HAVING NumRatings > 9
ORDER BY AvgRating DESC
LIMIT 200;

You could also write "INNER JOIN" instead of "JOIN" but the default in MySQL is that JOIN will mean inner join, so including the word "INNER" is optional.
Outer joins include left joins, right joins, or full outer joins (recall that full outer joins are NOT supported in MySQL).

Here's an example of a different query we used in the last lesson that employed the equijoin syntax:
SELECT d.user_guid AS UserID, d.dog_guid AS DogID, 
       d.breed, d.breed_type, d.breed_group
FROM dogs d, complete_tests c
WHERE d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid AND test_name='Yawn Warm-up';

How would you re-write this query using the traditional join syntax?
%%sql
SELECT d.user_guid, d.dog_guid, d.breed, d.breed_type, d.breed_group
FROM dogs d JOIN complete_tests c
    ON d.dog_guid = c.dog_guid
WHERE test_name = 'Yawn Warm-up'
LIMIT 10;

COUNT DISTINCT does NOT count NULL values

SELECT * 
FROM users
WHERE state IN ('NC','NY');

A query that would give an equivalent result would be:
SELECT * 
FROM users
WHERE state ='NC' OR state ='NY';

SELECT * 
FROM users
WHERE state NOT IN ('NC','NY');

EXISTS and NOT EXISTS perform similar functions to IN and NOT IN, but EXISTS and NOT EXISTS can only be used in subqueries. 
The syntax for EXISTS and NOT EXISTS statements is a little different than that of IN statements because EXISTS is not preceded by a column name or any other expression. 
The most important difference between EXISTS/NOT EXISTS and IN/NOT IN statements, though, is that unlike IN/NOT IN statements, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS are logical statements. 
Rather than returning raw data, per se, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS statements return a value of TRUE or FALSE. 
As a practical consequence, EXISTS statements are often written using an asterisk after the SELECT clause rather than explicit column names. 
The asterisk is faster to write, and since the output is just going to be a logical true/false either way, it does not matter whether you use an asterisk or explicit column names.

If we wanted to retrieve a list of all the users in the users table who were also in the dogs table, we could write:
SELECT DISTINCT u.user_guid AS uUserID
FROM users u
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT d.user_guid
              FROM dogs d 
              WHERE u.user_guid =d.user_guid);

You would get the same result if you wrote:
SELECT DISTINCT u.user_guid AS uUserID
FROM users u
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
              FROM dogs d 
              WHERE u.user_guid =d.user_guid);
Essentially, both of these queries say give me all the distinct user_guids from the users table that have a value of "TRUE" in my EXISTS clause. 
The results would be equivalent to an inner join with GROUP BY query. 

Queries that include subqueries always run the innermost subquery first, 
and then run subsequent queries sequentially in order from the innermost query to the outermost query.
